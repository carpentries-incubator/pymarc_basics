We often want to combine values of and perform calculations on rasters to create
a new output raster. This episode covers how to subtract one raster from
another using basic raster math. It also covers how to extract pixel values from a 
set of locations - for example a buffer region around locations at a field site.

## Raster Calculations in Python & Canopy Height Models
We often want to perform calculations on two or more rasters to create a new
output raster. For example, if we are interested in mapping the heights of trees
across an entire field site, we might want to calculate the difference between
the Digital Surface Model (DSM, tops of trees) and the
Digital Terrain Model (DTM, ground level). The resulting dataset is referred to
as a Canopy Height Model (CHM) and represents the actual height of trees,
buildings, etc. with the influence of ground elevation removed.

### Load the Data
For this episode, we will use the DTM and DSM from the
NEON Harvard Forest Field site and San Joaquin Experimental
Range, which we already have loaded from previous episodes. 
Let's load them again with `open_rasterio` using the argument `masked=True`.

```python
import rioxarray

surface_HARV = rioxarray.open_rasterio("data/NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/DSM/HARV_dsmCrop.tif", masked=True)
terrain_HARV_UTM18 = rioxarray.open_rasterio("data/NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/DTM/HARV_dtmCrop_UTM18.tif", masked=True)
```

## Raster Math
We can perform raster calculations by subtracting (or adding,
multiplying, etc) two rasters. In the geospatial world, we call this
"raster math", and typically it refers to operations on rasters that 
have the same width and height (including `nodata` pixels). We saw from 
the last episode's challenge that this is not the case with out DTM and DSM. Even though the `reproject` function gets our rasters into the same CRS, they have slighlty different extents.
We can now use the `reproject_match` function, which both reprojects and clips
a raster to the CRS and extent of another raster.

```python
terrain_HARV_matched = terrain_HARV_UTM18.rio.reproject_match(surface_HARV)
```

In fact, we could have used reproject_match on the original DTM model, "HARV_dtmCrop_WGS84.tif". If we had, this would mean one less time our DTM 
was interpolated with reprojection, though this has a negligible impact on 
the data for our purposes.

Let's subtract the DTM from the DSM to create a Canopy Height Model. 
We'll use `rioxarray` so that we can easily plot our result and keep 
track of the metadata for our CHM.

```python
canopy_HARV = surface_HARV - terrain_HARV_matched
canopy_HARV.compute()
```

We can now plot the output CHM. If we use the argument `robust=True`, our plot's color values
are stretched between the 2nd and 98th percentiles of the data, which results in clearer distinctions between forested and non-forested areas.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # in case it has not been imported recently
canopy_HARV.plot(cmap="viridis")
plt.title("Canopy Height Model for Harvard Forest, Z Units: Meters")
```
<img src="../fig/03-HARV-CHM-map-01.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-5" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-5" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />


Notice that the range of values for the output CHM is between 0 and 30 
meters. Does this make sense for trees in Harvard Forest?

Maps are great but it can also be informative to plot histograms of values to better understand the distribution. We can accomplish this using a built-in xarray method we have been already been using, `plot`

```python
plt.figure()
plt.style.use('ggplot') # adds a style to improve the aesthetics
canopy_HARV.plot.hist()
plt.title("Histogram of Canopy Height in Meters")
```

## Classifying Continuous Rasters in Python

Now that we have a sense of the distribution of our canopy height raster, we 
can reduce the complexity of our map by classifying it. Classification involves sorting raster values into unique classes, and in python, we can accomplish this using the `numpy.digitize` function. 

```python
import numpy as np

# Defines the bins for pixel values
class_bins = [canopy_HARV.min().values, 2, 10, 20, np.inf]

# Classifies the original canopy height model array
canopy_height_classified = np.digitize(canopy_HARV, class_bins)
print(type(canopy_height_classified))
```
```
<class 'numpy.ndarray'>
```

The result is a `numpy.ndarray`, but we can put this into a DataArray along with the spatial metadata from our `canopy_HARV`, so that our resulting plot shows the spatial coordinates.

```python
import xarray
canopy_height_classified = xarray.DataArray(canopy_height_classes, coords = canopy_HARV.coords)
plt.style.use("default")
plt.figure()
canopy_height_classified.plot()
```
![](../fig/03-HARV-CHM-class-04.png) 


> ## Plot Tip
> This plot looks nice but its legend could be improved. `matplotlib.pyplot` has all the tools needed to create a custom legend with unique labels for our classified map.

## Reassigning Geospatial Metadata and Exporting a GeoTIFF
When we computed the CHM, the output no longer contains reference to a nodata value, like `-9999.0`, which was associated with the DTM and DSM. Some calculations, like `numpy.digitize` can remove all geospatial metadata. Of what can be lost, the CRS and nodata value are particularly important to keep track of. Before we export the product of our calculation to a Geotiff with the `to_raster` function, we need to reassign this metadata.

```python
canopy_HARV.rio.write_crs(surface_HARV.rio.crs, inplace=True)
canopy_HARV.rio.set_nodata(-9999.0, inplace=True)
```

When we write this raster object to a GeoTIFF file we'll name it
`CHM_HARV.tiff`. This name allows us to quickly remember both what the data
contains (CHM data) and for where (HARVard Forest). The `to_raster()` function
by default writes the output file to your working directory unless you specify a
full file path.

```python
os.mkdirs("./data/outputs/", exist_ok=True)
canopy_HARV.rio.to_raster("./data/outputs/CHM_HARV.tif")
```
